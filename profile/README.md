## Introduction
SMU Machine Learning & Applications (MaLA) Lab consists of a team led by Assistant Professor [Guansong Pang](https://www.guansongpang.com/) in the School of Computing and Information Systems at Singapore Management University (SMU), working on a variety of machine learning, data mining, and computer vision problems.

We have a focal research theme on recognizing and generalizing to abnormal, unknown, or unseen data for building trustworthy AI systems in open worlds. Some research areas of particular interest include:

&nbsp;&nbsp; üçø Anomaly detection

&nbsp;&nbsp; üçø Open-world machine learning (e.g., out-of-distribution detection, open-set recognition, long-tailed classification, continual learning)

&nbsp;&nbsp; üçø Specialized foundation models for specific type of data (e.g., graphs, time series, tabular) or tasks (e.g., anomaly detection, forecasting)

&nbsp;&nbsp; üçø Security and safety in foundation models (hallucination mitigation, AI-generated content detection, defense against model/data attacks, etc.)

The team also explores some pivotal real-world applications of these areas, such as network intrusion detection, fraud detection, early detection of diseases/faults, learning from biomedicine data, industrial defect detection, biometric anti-spoofing, hate speech detection, etc.

The team has been actively collaborating with research teams led by various researchers, e.g., [Prof. Ling Chen](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=L5aYWQcAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Christopher Leckie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=wUsI0cAAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Xiao Bai](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=k6l1vZIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Peng Wang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=aPLp7pAAAAAJ), [Prof. Chunhua Shen](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Ljk2BvIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Ming-Sheng Shang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=1cKbdYEAAAAJ), [Prof. Kai-Ming Ting](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=9f3ZcbYAAAAJ), and [Prof. Gustavo Carneiro](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=E0TtOWAAAAAJ).

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
