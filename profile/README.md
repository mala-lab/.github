## Introduction
SMU Machine Learning & Applications (MaLA) Lab consists of a team led by Assistant Professor [Guansong Pang](https://www.guansongpang.com/) in the School of Computing and Information Systems at Singapore Management University (SMU), working on a variety of machine learning, data mining, and computer vision problems.

Some research areas of particular interest include:
- Anomaly detection
- Open-world learning (out-of-distribution detection, open-set recognition, long-tailed classification, continual learning, open-vocabulary learning, etc.)
- Graph representation learning
- Out-of-distribution generalization
- Deep reinforcement learning for knowledge discovery

The team also explores safety-critical and commercially/scientifically-significant real-world applications, 
including network intrusion detection, fraud detection, person re-identification, early detection of diseases, learning from biomedicine data, defect detection, biometric anti-spoofing, hate/toxic speech detection, etc.
