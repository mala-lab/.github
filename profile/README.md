# SMU Machine Learning & Applications (MaLA) Lab

## Introduction
MaLA Lab consists of a ML research team led by Assistant Professor [Guansong Pang](https://www.guansongpang.com/) in the School of Computing and Information Systems at Singapore Management University (SMU), working on detecting and understanding unknown or abnormal 
data instances to safeguard the security, privacy, and safety of data, systems, and models.

Some research areas of particular interest include:
- Anomaly detection
- Open-world learning (out-of-distribution detection, open-set recognition, long-tailed classification, continual learning, open-vocabulary learning, etc.)
- Graph representation learning
- Out-of-distribution generalization
- Deep reinforcement learning for knowledge discovery

The team also explores safety-critical and commercially/scientifically-significant real-world applications, 
including network intrusion detection, fraud detection, person re-identification, early detection of diseases, learning from biomedicine data, defect detection, biometric anti-spoofing, hate/toxic speech detection, etc.
